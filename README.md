OVERVIEW
This project involves cleaning and analyzing a real-world layoffs dataset using SQL, where I learned how to apply best practices for data cleaning and exploratory analysis in SQL.
The goal was to transform raw layoff data into a clean, analysis-ready format and uncover key insights into global layoff trends.

DATASET
Source: Layoffs.fyi
 â€“ data scraped and compiled on tech industry layoffs globally.
Format: CSV
Fields Included: Company, Location, Date, Number of Layoffs, Industry, etc.

Data Cleaning Steps (SQL)
Key data cleaning tasks performed:

Removed duplicates
Handled null and missing values
Converted data types (e.g., date formats)
Standardized inconsistent text entries (e.g., company names, locations)
Created new columns 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Some insights uncovered:
Top companies with the most layoffs
Countries/industries most affected
Layoffs by company name, every year

KEY LEARNINGS
Hands-on experience cleaning messy real-world data
Learned SQL techniques for EDA (GROUP BY, JOINs, WINDOW functions, etc.)
Reinforced importance of data quality before analysis
Practiced translating business questions into SQL queries
